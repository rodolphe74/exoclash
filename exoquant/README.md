# ExoQuant v0.7

ExoQuant is a high-quality, easy to use color quantization library. This is for you if you need one or more of the following:

* Very high-quality color reduction
* Reduction of images including alpha
* Creation of a shared palette for more than one image (or mipmap level)
* Dithering of the reduced image with very little noise

## Usage:

First, of course, you need to include `exoquant.h`:

    #include "exoquant.h"

Then for each image or texture to convert follow the following steps:

### Step 1: Initialise and set options.

First you need to init the library by calling `exq_init`:

    exq_data *pExq;
    pExq = exq_init();

Then you can set the following options:

#### Option: Alpha is no transparency

Use this option if you don't use the alpha channel of your image/texture as transparency or if the color is already premultiplied by the alpha. To set this option just call `exq_no_transparency`:

    exq_no_transparency(pExq);

### Step 2: Feed the image data

Now you need to feed the image data to the quantizer. The image data needs to be 32 bits per pixel. The first byte of each pixel needs to be the red channel, the last byte needs to be alpha.

To feed the image data you have to call `exq_feed`, which can be called more than once to create a shared palette for more than one image, for example for a texture with several mipmap levels:

    exq_feed(pExq, pImage_data, num_pixels);

### Step 3: Color reduction

    exq_quantize(pExq, num_colors);
    exq_quantize_hq(pExq, num_colors);
    exq_quantize_ex(pExq, num_colors, high_quality);

### Step 4: Retrieve the palette

    exq_get_palette(pExq, pPalette, num_colors);

### Step 5: Map the image to the palette

    exq_map_image(pExq, num_pixels, pIn, pOut);
    exq_map_image_ordered(pExq, width, height, pIn, pOut);

### Step 6: Clean up

Call `exq_free` to free the quantization data:

   exq_free(pExq);
